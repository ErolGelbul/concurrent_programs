    "In this session you have learned about the two central modules that support concurrent programming in Python, `threading` and `multiprocessing`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Lesson 1: Shared state without synchronisation is problematic.\n",
    "We have studied a practical example of concurrent banking transactions in which we  deliberately used a shared state variable (\"balance\") without proper synchronisation. The problem that this causes is that the variable's value will be different depending on the order of execution of the concurrent threads (Exercise 3) or processes (Exercise 4). The programmer has no control over the order in which concurrent threads or processes are executed. Therefore, __you should never write concurrent code without ensuring proper synchronisation!__\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Lesson 2: There are differences between `threading` and `multiprocessing` \n",
    "The `threading` module works with threads, that is, the local variables are still visible in the context of the threads. That's why we can use the `global` statement to share variables between threads. (Did we mention that doing so without proper synchronisation is to be avoided?) \n",
    "\n",
    "The `multiprocessing` module uses processes, which means that the code that is executed in separate processes cannot by default access code in other processes. Any sharing of values must happen through specific means, like e.g. the  `Value` class that we used. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Outlook\n",
    "The `multiprocessing` and `threading` modules provides many more means to synchronise state between threads and processes. We will learn about some of those in the next session.\n",
